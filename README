Explain how to run your code here.

HOW TO RUN OUR CODE:

Run main10Folds.py.

You can adjust the number of epochs on line 40 in the train function.

The neural network is already set up.

If you want to change cross validation params, go to the crossValidation function.
For example, you can change the number of folds there.

We only chose to read in 10 files, so the for-loop only goes 10 times to
append the files and labels, but if you want more files, simply change the
number of times the for-loop runs.

Lastly, in the folds for-loop, the input for the zeros function (when
creating a numpy array called 'b') should reflect the number of files you input.
Because we had 10 files, we created b with ten 'False' values.

The start and end values should be changed according to the number of files
and the number of folds. For example, if you have 40 files and 10 folds,
start should be i*4 and end should be (i+1) * 4, so that each fold has ten files.

HOW WE PREPROCESSED THE DATA:
We downloaded the data from the Cats Vs. Dogs competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). We used 20,024
images from the train folder in the data set. We preprocessed the images by padding
the smaller images with zeros to create a black border so that all the images had the
same size. The final size of the images were 768 x 1050 pixels, each with RGB values.
We then normalized the RGB colors (0 as the min and 255 as the max).
After preprocessing all of the images, we wrote them into
40 separate files containing shuffled photos, along with one file
containing the corresponding labels for each photo.
